deployed app: https://ncnewsapiproject.netlify.app

This project involved me creating a fake back end api for a website called nc-news.
I had two weeks to create the front end and back end of the website.
The functions for this app include: posting comments, liking posts, deleting comments.

To run this repo locally you have to use "git clone https://github.com/Spoomgull/nc-news-front-end.git" in the terminal
and then use "npm install"
and then "npm run dev"
